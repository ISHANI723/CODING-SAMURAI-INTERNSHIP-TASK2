# TASK 2 : To-Do List Web Application Project
Create a web-based to-do list application that allows users to
manage their tasks and stay organized. This project will involve building a user interface
to add, edit, and mark tasks as completed. It's a great way for beginners to learn about
web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and potentially a backend technology
like Node.js.
